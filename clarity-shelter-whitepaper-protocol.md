# Clarity Shelter Whitepaper Protocol

Clarity shelter token is a new project about to be launched on the BSC network and our aim is to help the less privileged and supporting them in any way we can, this is a give back token. CHO token i.e clarity shelter token is our eco system token,invest in clarity shelter token to own a share of all operations and solutions within our eco system.

Clarity Shelter Token Staking; CH0 will be developing a staking contract to easily allow token holders to stake for one, six or twelve months.

Clarity Shelter Token Projects; Clarity shelter and home is the brain child of the token, a platform the team uses to give back. Clarity shelter employees work directly with other project owners to bring thier members a staking portal for thier token. Users gain reward in an owner selected APY that encourage long term holding. This is a great opportunity for projects to provide some benefits for team and staff, while the token benefits from a staking pool at a one time onboarding cost and annual renewal.

Buy Back and Burn; a percentage from sale from every project onboarding our staking portal will go directly towards our buy back and burn systems. We also have some exciting  other burn announcements coming after launch.
